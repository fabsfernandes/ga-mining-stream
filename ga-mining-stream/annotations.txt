== Decisions

1) Generate full dataset first, before start reading
2) Window resizing strategy
3) Create population with last gene representing correct class
4) Load window with chromossomes: last gene representing correct class and all genes active

5) Rules with at least one antecedent TODO (population, crossover, fitness, ...)
6) Fitness function: when there is no A (division by 0) => predictive accuracy = 0
7) Elite selection fixed in 20% - 10 parents
8) What is "one rule overlap and contradicts other"?
9) Sera q tem problema manter a populacao ordenada pelo fitness?
