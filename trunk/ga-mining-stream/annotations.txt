== Decisions

1) Generate full dataset first, before start reading
2) Window resizing strategy
3) Create population with last gene representing correct class
4) Load window with chromossomes: last gene representing correct class and all genes active

5) Rules with at least one antecedent TODO (population, crossover, fitness, ...)
5) Fitness function: when there is no A (division by 0) => predictive accuracy = 0
